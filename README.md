## üí∞ Crypto Wallet Seed Backup Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant HUSHBOX
    participant SecureStorage
    participant BackupMedium

    User->>HUSHBOX: Enter seed phrase + strong passphrase
    HUSHBOX->>HUSHBOX: Encrypt seed using AES-256-GCM
    HUSHBOX->>User: Generate secured QR code
    User->>BackupMedium: Print QR on titanium plate
    User->>SecureStorage: Store in fireproof safe
    Note over User,SecureStorage: Store passphrase separately (e.g. password manager)
    User->>HUSHBOX: Destroy local session
```

### Security Features for Crypto Seeds
- **Multi-Location Storage**: QR physical backup + digital passphrase
- **Redundancy**: Create multiple QR backups for different locations
- **Tamper Evidence**: QR contains HMAC signature to detect alterations
- **Time-Lock**: Optional delayed decryption feature
- **Plausible Deniability**: Seed appears as random data in QR

    participant Admin
    participant HUSHBOX
    participant Employee
    participant ActiveDirectory

    Admin->>HUSHBOX: Generate new credentials
    HUSHBOX->>HUSHBOX: Create password + encrypt
    HUSHBOX->>Admin: Produce secure QR
    Admin->>ActiveDirectory: Update credentials
    ActiveDirectory-->>Admin: Confirmation
    Admin->>Employee: Distribute QR via secure channel
    Employee->>HUSHBOX: Scan QR + authenticate
    HUSHBOX->>Employee: Reveal credentials
    Employee->>Systems: Login with new credentials
```

### Security Advantages
- **No Plaintext Transmission**: Credentials never sent via email/chat
- **One-Time Use**: QR invalidates after first scan
- **Biometric Verification**: Optional face/fingerprint unlock
- **Usage Analytics**: Track credential distribution
- **Auto-Rotation**: Schedule regular password updates

```

### Diplomatic Security Features
- **Plausible Deniability**: Message appears as random data if intercepted
- **Duress Detection**: Hidden warning if decrypted under coercion
- **Multi-Party Auth**: Require 2 officers to decrypt
- **Geofencing**: Only decrypt in authorized locations
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Zero device persistence

## üõ°Ô∏è Implementation Tips for All Workflows

1. **Physical Backup Best Practices**:
   - Use archival-quality paper or titanium plates
   - Laminate with UV-protective coating
   - Store in fireproof/waterproof containers
   - Create geographical distribution (multiple locations)

2. **Passphrase Management**:
   ```mermaid
   pie
       title Passphrase Storage Methods
       "Password Manager" : 45
       "Physical Vault" : 30
       "Memorization" : 15
       "Split Knowledge" : 10
   ```

3. **Security Verification Schedule**:
   - Monthly: Test decryption process
   - Quarterly: Rotate master passphrases
   - Annually: Replace physical backups
   - Biannually: Security audit penetration test

4. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Maintain 3-2-1 backup rule:
     - 3 copies of QR
     - 2 different media types (paper/metal/digital)
     - 1 offsite location

These workflows demonstrate HUSHBOX's versatility across high-security scenarios. Each implementation maintains the core principles of zero-server architecture and client-side encryption while adapting to specific industry requirements.
